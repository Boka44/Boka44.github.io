		<p><em>My name is Nicholas Hrboka. I am a self-taught web developer with a background in sales and 
		recruiting from San Pedro, California. The most important thing you should know about me is that I 
		have a deep passion for creating, rooted in my love for making and performing original music.</em> 
		<br/>
		<br/>
		I absolutely love the concept of creating something organically from scratch. Some things in particular 
		being video games, board games, websites, applications, even a fantasy novel I have been writing for 
		some time. Creation is my constant, and my drive can not get enough of it. </p>
		<hr/>
		<p>In March of 2017, I began teaching myself programming while at the time working a corporate sales 
		job selling business loans. I enjoyed my past careers working with people in sales and recruiting, 
		though I never quite found that feeling of fulfillment I was looking for with them. As I always had 
		an interest in the tech industry, I started learning javascript on codeacademy.com after work every day.
		<br/>
		<br/> 
		Soon after, I began creating personal projects using HTML and CSS. Eventually, I began teaching myself 
		Node and React and found that everything just clicked. Getting a taste of this new found love for 
		programming lead to the quitting of my sales job in August to pursue a career and future as a software 
		developer. Now I create fullstack applications using Javascript, HTML, CSS, Node, React and many more 
		languages and frameworks. Took a C++ class at a local community college where I not only thoroughly enjoyed 
		creating various new programs, 
		I even scored a perfect 100% in the class. Currently working as a freelance developer with multiple clients
		and a quickly growing portfolio.</p>
		<hr/>
		<p>I believe life should be a constant adventure. Hiking, road trips, live music, sports, swimming, gaming, and 
		the like. I love trying new things and making new experiences and look forward to my future as a software 
		developer being one of them.</p>
